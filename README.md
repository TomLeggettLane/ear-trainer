# Ear Trainer

A Web application created to practice aural recognition for music theory, an important skill for musicians.
Currently only the 'Interval Training' and 'Chord Recognition' sections are available.

Created using React. 

## Description

I wanted to create an Ear Trainer as there aren't many great online resources for aural training.

This was my first project using React. I used Tone.js to create the synth sounds, Howler.js to play audio files, and Bootstrap and CSS.

### Interval Training
 * Plays 2 notes, then lets the user choose the interval between them. 
 * User can choose if the interval is played ascending, descending, or in unison
 * Users can choose which intervals are included from a 2 octave selection
 * Customizable synth sounds and game settings
 * Customizable game settings - number of guesses/repeats/answer boxes and the audio playback speed

### Chord Training
 * Plays a chord, then lets the user choose the chord value 
 * User can choose if the chord is played ascending, descending, or in unison
 * Users can choose which chords they can be quizzed on from a wide selection
 * All customizable settings in Interval Training are also available here.
