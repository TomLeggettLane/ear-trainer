# Ear Trainer

A Web application created to practice aural recognition for music theory, an important skill for musicians.
Currently only the 'Interval Training' and 'Chord Recognition' sections are available./

Created using React. 

## Description

![screenshot](/src/images/demo-img1.png)

I wanted to create an Ear Trainer as there aren't many great online resources for aural training.\

This was my first project using React.\

I was motivated to learn React via a personal project after completing Angela Yu's "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" course.\
