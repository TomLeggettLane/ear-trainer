# Ear Trainer

This project is a Web application created to practice aural recognition for music theory - an important skill for musicians. 
The Interval Training, and Chord Recognition sections are currently available. Created using React and Bootstrap. 


# Description

This was my first project using React. 

I wanted to create this app as some of my music students told me there weren't many good online recourses for practicing Aural Training.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
